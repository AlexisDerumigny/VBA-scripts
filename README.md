# VBA-scripts
 
Some VBA scripts that can be useful.
Currently, there is only one VBA script in this repository:

- `GatherAllNotesInWordFile`: a VBA module for Powerpoint that
exports all the "Notes" (on each slide) to a Word document with the same name.
Currently only tested on Windows.

- `GatherAllNotesInWordFilev2`: a second version that can manage a parallel slide numbering
(for example, if some of your slides are not numbered while others are,
and you would like to keep track of this other slide numbering method).
